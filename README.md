# Hangman game

A Java based Hangman game first planned to use a Swing GUI, for the first year of my bachelor degree in Business Computing.

## Bonus features I've included
- JavaFX GUI
- Database usage with SQLite
- Music player
- MVP pattern
- Unit testing
- Environment variables (JSON)
- API fetching (Wordnik API)

## What I would improve
- SQLite database should not be in the repository, there should be migrations instead.
- I would consider creating a router instead of the "appPresenter"
- MVP might not be the best pattern for a GUI application, it would probably be better to inspire from Angular workflow with only services and models.
